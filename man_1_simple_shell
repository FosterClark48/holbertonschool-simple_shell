.SH SYNOPSIS
[command [flags] [files]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command interpreter simple_shell is a shell based on the sh or bash shells. It works in an interactive mode or non interactive mode,
an interactive mode means it can read commands from a user on a terminal and a non-interactive shell is a shell that can not interact with the user.
Its most often run from a script or similar. In general, starts by checking if a file descriptor refers to a terminal, then simple_shell waits
to read the line, interprets the command, if the command is valid it will be excuted, otherwise it prints a descriptive error.
Most of the commands used are located in the environment variable called PATH
